## SubstackToGhost

The script takes in an export folder from Substack, and generates a Ghost-JSON compliant export, ready to import into Ghost. 
Requires Erlang installed. 
For now, just slams html into mobiledoc cards. 
WIP. Todo: 
    - better option parsing
    - standalone executable? 
    - test cards vs other mobiledoc options
